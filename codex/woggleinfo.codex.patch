     "Info\n\nWhat is a Woggle?\nWoggles are an ancient magical race from a lost era.\nCasualties from the war with the Ruin have made them an extremely rare species, and you are one of the few prestigeous individuals to care for one!\nYou have been entrusted with the newest generation of woggles, and their future rests in your hands.",
     "General Care\n\n1. Woggles should be fed twice daily on a diet of colorful candy. Failure to do so may lower your Woggle's morale and lead to disastrous consequences.\n2. If the Woggle should show signs of anger or depression, offer them stimulating playtime ASAP. Suggested playtime is 2 hours, or until mood improves.\n3. Woggle should be bathed at least once a day.
