# Spooky Integrations

Spooky Integrations is a companion mod for Spooky Tweaks that expands the overhauling into other mods. The end result is a consistent game experience across the modded environment, using the style and balance provided in Spooky Tweaks.

Like in Spooky Tweaks, this mod adds no __new__ save-altering content! You can add and remove it at any time without destroying your saves. Please remember to always make save backups when using mods.

# Project Highlights
## General
- Instruments are one handed, rare, worth 2000 pixels, and sold by Chip Tunes
- Themed alternative items match vanilla tweaks (ex Avali Flashlight)
- Crafting stations moved to different tiers of the inventors table
- Teleporters are platforms, and can be recovered when broken
- Moon related things are just as spooky
- Staves and wands take 0.6s to charge

**Mod Specific**
- Magnorb shields have no energy cost when using Expanded Magnorbs
- Endgame Avali items are more powerful than vanilla items
- All in one Erchius EPP can't be crafted due to being OP
- No Ghost Augment is worth less to prevent money exploits
- Explorepods are sold for 30,000 pixels
- Purple Stim Pack only lasts for 180s
- Shipments always sell for 100%
- Transmutation tables support unused ore items
